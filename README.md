# spam-email-classifier

This was part of a university coursework to determine spam and ham emails based off of a given list of features. Initially I used Naive Bayes to solve this and my model was able to achieve an accuracy of 89% with the data given. I then switched to using logistic regression and after some optimization was able to get 94.6% accuracy on my final model.
